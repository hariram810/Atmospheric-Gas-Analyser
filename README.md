This Is An AtmosphericGasAnanlyser Using MQ Series Sensors, Dht-11 Sensor & Arduino The Basic Idea Is To Precisely Measure Data Using Sensors Analog Read & Display It In I2CLcd, Here The Sensors Can Give Values Of LPG, CNG, HYDROGEN, AIR-QUALITY This Project Can Be Used To Collect Sensor Readings For FutureResearchProcesses. If You Need You Can Simply Add An SD Card To Store The Data As String And Collect The Readings, Here For Simplicity & SpaceReduction Iam Using Arduino Nano And I2ClCD Display, For My Ease. The Sensors Spit Out Aanalog Readings And I Have Converted It Into Useful PPM Values Of The Sensors analogToPPM(analogRead(The Sensor)). It Is Very Useful So I Have Converted It To PPM,

Connecting the hardware and Reading the analog value is easy, but the most difficult thing is to calibrate the sensors and calculating the ppm(parts per million) value for a specific gas. After searching for a long time on the internet, I find a library for those sensors. And comparing the calculation with the datasheet of the sensors, it seems promising.

Here I found an article that explains the working and the calculation for an MQ sensor- UNDERSTANDING A GAS SENSOR.

I use the library and write a code to use six of those sensors with an Arduino nano and show different gas concentrations on air.

You can find the library here - MQUnifiedsensor library
